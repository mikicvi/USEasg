# Software Engineering 2 Assignment

You can choose one of the following:
• Extend and test a more comprehensive USE model for the Library system in USE
• Extend and test the USE model from the Restaurant lab tes
• extend the Java implementation of the Restaurant system to include another use case. Also 
expected to provide a use case realisation (sequence diagram and any consequent changes 
to the analysis class model) for this use case.
• Construct and test a USE model for Accounts Receivable Processor example in Design by 
Contract notes.
• Using Junit, construct a test site for some of the application domain classes in the Restaurant 
system.
• Try something of interest to you but to be agreed with me. For instance try to do some 
design by contact code in Java for Library or restaurant.

# You must produce a report in PDF which explanatory test and diagrams. Quality of report just as 
important as the diagrams, even more so.

# In the first two options, the following tpes of diagram would be required: class, sequence, 
statemachine (statechart), object. Also OCL contracts for some of the operations along with !openter 
and !opexit testing. Whatever you decide to model, it must include:
• You must a some more use cases besides borrow)/return() in Library or 
slectBooking()/recordArrival() in Restaurant. Describe the extra use case scenarios before 
you model them. For example change table or reserve a book.
• USE model with preconditions, postconditions and invariants. The USE code must be copied 
to your report as well as being submitted separately. 
• Constraints must be tested with objects. Better to use SOIL implementations to make the 
testing easier. However, use !openter !opexit to test at least one method, note that 
methods with SOIL implementations can’t be tested with !openter and !opexit.
• Use Windows snipping tool or something similar to copy and paste all your diagrams into 
your report.
• Use screen captures of testing on the command prompt window and paste them into the 
report.
• Also create at least two sequence diagrams in USE.
• When you can get the basics to work, build a State Machine for at least one class, such as 
the Reservation class for the library. Test drive this state machine and copy and paste it in 
while in various stated into your report.

# All the above must be put in a report along with a discussion and analysis, i.e. copy diagrams and 
screen captures to you Word document. Convert the Word document to a PDF before submitting.
Report is expected to have all the diagrams/screen captures from USE. 
Note: The adding a reservation use case to the Library system greatly complicates it and is not at all 
straightforward. You have to think carefully about what a reservation means, which of course if the 
purpose of analysis modelling.

# Submission
Report in PDF and USE files (.use and .soil) to be submitted thru Brightspace. Do not use ZIP or 
RAR.
